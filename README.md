# Market Sales Service

## Overview
The Market Sales Service is a reactive, serverless REST API built with Java, Spring WebFlux, and AWS DynamoDB for managing market sales.
This service allows users to create, view, update, and delete sales.
With a reactive stack using Spring WebFlux, itâ€™s optimized for high throughput, non-blocking requests, making it scalable and suitable for cloud-native applications.

## Features
* Reactive API: Fully non-blocking API using Spring WebFlux.
* AWS DynamoDB Integration: Leverages DynamoDB as the persistent data store.
* CRUD Operations: Create and retrieve market sales.
* Sales Status Tracking: Track sales statuses.
* Scalable and Cloud-ready: Serverless and ready to deploy on AWS infrastructure.
